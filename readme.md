Visual Studio Community 2019 is a free software program provided to you through the good folks at Microsoft. You can download it by clicking the purple logo above.

> How To Download My Apps
>-------------------------
> Please feel free to clone and test my console apps.
> 1. Since I'm using C# as my programming language, please make sure you have already downloaded Visual Studio Community 2019. Click on the purple icon above if you'd like a download. VS Community 2019 runs on windows and can be bootcamped onto Macs.
> 2. There's a few different ways you can go about downloading my console apps, but I recommend if you're new to coding, just click on the green "Code" button to the right of the repository page to download the file. It'll be a zip file so after downloading, open your file explorer. Find the file whereever it is you chose to download it, and hit "Extract All" and then also select where you'd like to extract it. 
> 3. Once Extracted, find the file titled "GoldBadgeConsoleAppThreeChallenges". 
> 4. Then double click on the solution file called "GoldBadgeConsoleAppThreeChallenges.sln".
> 5. All my console apps will automatically open in VS Community 2019, assuming you have that downloaded already.

> How To Run My Apps
>--------------------
> 1. In order to run any one of my apps, you'll want to go to the solution explorer to the right of your screen. There you'll find my stack of console applications. Depending on which one you're interested in, right click on the Main consoles titled something along the iteration of "No_ChallengeNoConsole" and select "Start As Project Startup". 
> 2. If for whatever reason your solution explorer isn't already pinned to the right of your screen, then just go to the top icon under view and select Solution Explorer or just use the shortcut Ctrl Alt L and following all the steps as aforementioned in step 1.
> 3. Then go to the Green Start button at the top of your screen and start the console application that you chose to run first. 
> 4. Lastly, just follow the prompts and enjoy the apps I've created.

> What To Expect
>---------------
> 1. For Challenge One Console, I've created an app that let's the user manage a food menu. You'll get the option of creating new menu items, updating menu items, deleting menu items, and receiving a list of items on the menu.
> 2. For Challenge Two Console, I've created a queue that allows an insurance specialist to manage their claims. You'll be able to see all your claims, take care of the next claim, enter a new claim, and modify an existing claim.
> 3. For Challenge Three Console, I've created created a dictionary of badges that allows a security specialist to manage badges that have access to doors. You'll be able to create a new badge, edit an existing badge, and see a list of all badges.

> Goals of the code
>---------------
> 1. One goal of this code is explore the relationships and intereactions between C# objects in relation to collections, such as lists, queues, and dictionaries.
> 2. Another goal for this code was to practice for myself MVP and being able to better realize what is essential and what isn't yet essential for a software developer in relation to when they get hired for a job. 
> 3. Through these console applications, I've learned that communication is vital between the client and the software developer because what is sent via an email could be different vastly to how the software developer interprets the code. The software developer could devide to just turn something out so the client gets a rough layout of what they may want, but I think it's better to sometimes get better clarifiaton on some instrutions because that saves time getting the prototype out to the client. I've learned that it's better to error on the side of caution because it also saves the software developer loads of time doing research into a funtionality that the client may not want. 
> 4. Another goal of this code was for me to better understand unit tests for console applications. On this point, I've got to admit, I'm still a bit confused on some aspects of them, but I do admit they can be helpful.
> 5. Going forward, should you have any feedback or recommendations on how to refactor some of my code better, please feel free to reach out to me on github. 
> 6. Enjoy!
